Lightroom to Wordpress Publish Server
-------------------------------------

This plugin lets you post to wordpress directly from lightroom. It creates a new post when you add a photo to the collection with meta data from the image. Caption and Title need to be specified. It'll then retrieve any comments, and it'll try to link lightroom categories to wordpress equivalents (they need to already exist in wordpress). Then it will upload the image to the media library and set it as the featured image for the new post. Ideal for single post photoblog.


It consists of a wordpress plugin and a lightroom plugin.
